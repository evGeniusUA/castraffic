Suggestions how to reduce Phantom Jams with driving aid

Background
> Information about phantom jams
> Real "simulation" in Japan

Introduction to simulator

Simulations of original traffic (fastest possible and "normal" drivers)
> Driver rules (show equation)
> Setup + resultplots + comparison with real report (suryjama)

Possible solutions
> Radar and a solution to restrict speed
> A device that recognize if a car several cars ahead brake

Simulations of traffic with aid (distance + brakehelp and brakedetection)

Comparison/Conclusion
