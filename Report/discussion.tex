\section{Discussion \and Conclusion}
Real-world traffic systems are complex, composed of light and heavy vehicles,
complex road systems, individual drivers etc. We however, have chosen to work
with a minimalistic model, still capable of reproducing phantom jams as
observed in real-world traffic.\\\\

Observations from our simulations indicate 

%% Sum -up conclusion
To sum up; Traffic jams is a severe problem in the world today. Building new
roads or modifying old road systems to reduce jams and improve road
performance costs huge amounts of money. Our simulations clearly indicates
that automatic or semi-automatic vehicle control systems have the potential
shift the critical level of traffic density at which phantom jams occur,
upwards. Also, the performance penalty for any occurring jams is reduced.
This means that existing road systems could handle heavier or much heavier
traffic.

% bla, bla, för och nackdelar. Enkel modell. Med fler parametrar - ytterligare
% dämpande?
% Undersök effekter av implementeringsgrad.

% Inte helt simpelt - adc kan öka problem \cite

% Utformning av eadc, förslag och potential
% eacc behöver väldigt hög implementeringsgrad eftersom de inte kan kommunicera annars

% Sum up: Indicates improvement....
