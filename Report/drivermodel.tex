\subsection{Driver model}
Several microscopic models have been developed to simulate different traffic
situations. These models are used to describe the position and velocity of each car in the simulation and can then much easier be compared with empirical data than in macroscopic models. Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) is a car-following
model and belongs to the deterministic kind of microscopic models \ref{idm}.\\\\

The IDM control the position of the car on a single-lane road. The position depends on the velocity and acceleration of the car. Acceleration is described by the velocity \begin{math}v_\alpha\end{math} and distance to the car in front \begin{math}s_\alpha\end{math}. These two parts are related to the desired velocity \begin{math}v_0\end{math} and effective desired distance \begin{math}s^\ast\end{math}. The equation for acceleration then becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{driver_acc}\dot{v_\alpha} = a(1-(\frac{v_\alpha}{v_0})^\delta-(\frac{s^\ast}{s_0})^2)\end{equation}
Desired distance between the cars is calculated from minimum distance \begin{math}s_0\end{math}, time headway \begin{math}T\end{math} and difference in velocity \begin{math}\Delta v = v_\alpha - v_{\alpha + 1}\end{math}.
\begin{equation}\label{desireddist}s^\ast = s_0 + max(v_\alpha T + \frac{v_\alpha \Delta v}{2\sqrt{ab}})\end{equation}
