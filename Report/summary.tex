On highways there are often traffic jams that seem to have no apparent reason. These are called Phantom jams and occur because the traffic-system reaches instability at a certain density of cars. In this state very small changes of the flow will create jams.
In this project we have created a simulator that uses a microscopic model that mimics the behavior of a normal driver and the dynamics of a car to recreate these Phantom jams. From this model we have also analyzed different technical solutions that could reduce the effects of Phantom jams. We have tested the adaptive cruise control system and an enhanced method suggested from us.
From these simulations it was found that both suggested methods would reduce Phantom jams and increase flow.
