Traffic jams occur all the time for no appearent reason. These jams
are called \emph{phantom jams} and occur when the traffic-system reaches
instability at a certain traffic density. In this state very small changes
in the flow are amplified and form a sustained travelling traffic-jam wave.
We have created a simulator from a microscopic traffic model that mimics
the behavior of a normal driver and the dynamics of a car to reproduce these
phantom jams. We have analyzed two technical systems that could reduce the
effects of phantom jams, the Adaptive Cruise Control system and an enhanced
version of it, suggested by us. In our simulations, both systems have been
found to reduce phantom jams and increase traffic flow.  \end{abstract}
