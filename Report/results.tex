\section{Results}
Our simulator was designed to be similar to the experiments made by Sugiyama et al.\ref{sugiyama} since data can be compared. Figure (FIXME::) shows the absolute position on the circular road of all the 60 cars for $ 150 \unit{s}$. In this plot it can be seen that several of the cars come to a complete stop after $30 \unit{s}$. These stops can be characterized as waves \ref{mit} that are moving in the opposite direction of the cars driving direction with a constant speed of (FIXME: speed).\\\\

In figures (FIXME: ) there are data from the simulator when the cars are equipped with ACC and EACC respectively and the jam dynamics can be seen. In these cases the cars are never forced to stop completely. When the cars are equipped with ACC the jams does not occur until after $400 \units{s}$

\subsection{Comparison of Performance}
We measure performance of the different systems as average traffic flow
$[\unit{vehicles/h}]$ as a function of average traffic density
$[\unit{vehicles/km}]$. The speed limit was fixed to $50 \unit{km/h}$ in all
experiments. Data is presented in fig \ref{performace}.\\\\

Initially, the performance of all three systems grow linearly as traffic is
light enough to allow all cars to keep maximum allowed speed. As traffic grows
denser, the cars have to slow down to keep constant time headway. All three
system follow the same performance curve until a density of $50.0
\unit{vehicles/km}$ is reached. At this point, phantom jams appear in the
\emph{normal driver} system and traffic flow drops dramatically. For the
\emph{Adaptive Cruise Control} system and the \emph{Enhanced Adaptive Cruise
Control} system, phantom jams were first observed at $56.3 \unit{vehicles/km}$
and $68.8 \unit{vehicles/km}$ respectively. Fig \ref{performance} also shows
that the performance of these two systems is not reduced by the phantom jams
as severely as for the \emph{normal driver}.
