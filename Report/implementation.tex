\section{Implementation}
\subsection{Normal driver}
The IDM is developed to describe a normal behavior of cars in traffic and hence we have implemented the model in our simulations with only one difference. delay of the acceleration which represents a reaction time which must be considered since it takes about 1s for a human to react to changes in the traffic\ref{idm}. Our model is then implemented as equations (FIXME: eq) but with a delay \begin{math}T_r\end{math} on the acceleration.
