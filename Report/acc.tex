\section{Methods to reduce jams}
A technology to increase safety for drivers in traffic is Adaptive Cruise
Control (ACC) which is the next generation of cruise control. This kind of
system is able to measure the distance to and speed of the car infront and then
adapt the own speed so a certain time gap is maintained between the cars. ACC
is already commercially available on the market and there is much research
going on to determine the effects on traffic flow when more and more vehicles are
equipped with this system \cite{acc}. The biggest advantage of the system
is the increased comfort of the driver but also safety is increased. A human
driver is mostly not very good at estimating the distance to or the velocity of the car
in front. This can cause unneccessary brakes or accelerations. Also because of
some drivers behaviour, time headway between cars is shorter than a normal
driver require to adapt to changes in traffic flow. Since ACC is
able to measure the distance and velocity with good precision and adapts
the speed to always keep a safe time headway to the car in front, not much
braking and accelerating is needed. (FIXME: ref till not)\\\\

% Nice intro EACC, snyggt sammanbundet!
One ability that human drivers have but ACC lack is the possibility to look
ahead in traffic. One example is the breaking light that can be seen through
several cars. 
%This ability increses both safety and in some cases traffic flow.%
 A problem with this is the difficulty to estimate the speed of the
cars ahead. The only information available is that the cars further ahead are
breaking. We have thought of a system that have the advantages of the ACC and
the possibility to look further ahead in traffic. This enhanced model could
be realized by communication between the cars that are travelling in the same
direction. 
%Var skall vi ha den har meningen? den bryter in mellan...
There has been some research on communication between cars;
(FIXME: Kesting et al. ) have tested the connectivity of such a system. The
enhanced system can then adapt speed to the cars further up in line
and possibly reduce fluctuations in traffic flow even more.
