\section{Methods to reduce jams}
A technology to increase safety for drivers in traffic is Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) which is the next generation of cruise control. This kind of system is able to measure the distance and speed to the car infront and then adapt the speed so a certain time gap is maintained between the cars. ACC is already commercially available on the market and there is much research going on to see the effect in traffic flow when more and more vehicles are equipped with this system \cite{acc}.
